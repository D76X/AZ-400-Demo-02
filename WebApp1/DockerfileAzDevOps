#See https://aka.ms/customizecontainer to learn how to customize your debug container and how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.
#This Dockerfile is extremely simple because it is used to build
#the image starting from the published binaries of the application.
#This means that the Dockerfile is not a multi-stage Dockerfile and
#only the name of the ENTRYPOINT assembly is required among other few details
